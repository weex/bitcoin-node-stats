# bitcoin-node-stats
Pulls API data and summarizes sync'd node counts

This script pulls json data from the bitnodes.com API and does some simple stats on it. This was created to get a better view on the XT vs Core nodes count and bases stats on nodes being synchronized (i.e. being on the latest or previous block) rather than just being present.
